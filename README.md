# Hurricane-Visualizations
I enjoy watching the weather, analyzing data, and looking at pretty pictures, so I though I'd start this project.

## All Storms
This is for data from the IBTrACS-All which includes basically every peice of tropical cyclone data from around the globe.
The original source file from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ibtracs-data-access was pretty messy so edit.py cleans it up and arranges it neatly.

## North Atlantic Hurdat
This is for data from Hurdat2 which is for the North Atlantic basin only. This data has been reanalyzed and includes much more detail than the IBTrACS data set.
